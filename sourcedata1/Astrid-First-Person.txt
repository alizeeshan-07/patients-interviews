So, I found my pediatrician through word of mouth recommendations from people in my neighborhood. Initially, I had a pediatrician in the group, but I switched to a different doctor within the practice because the first one just didn't listen to my concerns. I didn't do any online research or read reviews, but my friends recommended the group, and my health insurance seemed to think they were good, so I gave it a shot. Overall, I've had a positive experience with the group.

When it comes to my child's developmental delays, it's been quite a journey to get a diagnosis. I noticed that my child had trouble nursing and missed some important milestones. My previous doctor didn't take my concerns seriously, so I decided to switch pediatricians and seek early intervention through the Alliance for Toddlers and Infants. It was frustrating because my previous doctor even gave me the wrong phone number for the organization.

As for reactions or regressions after vaccinations, I never experienced any. I didn't really look into specific websites or organizations related to autism; instead, I relied on the information provided by my doctors and the geneticist I consulted. My child was initially diagnosed with global developmental delays at nine months and later received an autism diagnosis at four years old. We went through various genetic tests, but thankfully, all came back negative.

I consulted different medical professionals during this journey, including a geneticist at McGee Women's Hospital, doctors at the children's hospital's development unit, and the children's institute genetic department. However, I stopped going to these appointments about six years ago and have been focusing on therapy and other programs since then. Recently, due to my child's regression, I'm considering more testing, and my pediatrician is helping me connect with doctors at the children's hospital.

As for my beliefs regarding vaccines causing autism, honestly, I don't know. I haven't run a group for individuals with autism or anything like that.

In conclusion, I've shared with you my experiences in finding a pediatrician, seeking early intervention, and getting a diagnosis for my child. I faced frustration with my previous doctor's dismissive attitude and the incorrect information provided. But my current pediatrician has been supportive, helping me connect with specialists. As for the link between vaccines and autism, I remain uncertain and haven't actively sought information from specific websites or organizations.
