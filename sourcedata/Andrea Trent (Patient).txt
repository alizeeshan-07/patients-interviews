As a patient, I have always chosen to vaccinate my children because I believe that the benefits outweigh the risks. My children attend daycare and are exposed to a lot of germs, so I feel that vaccination is an important way to protect them from preventable diseases. I have seen the positive effects of vaccination firsthand, as my children have never contracted any of the diseases they have been vaccinated for, except for my daughter who had pneumonia when she was nine months old. 

I also appreciate that the daycare providers require vaccination and keep shot records on file. This helps to ensure that all the children in the daycare are protected and reduces the risk of outbreaks. I remember having to get my own shots when I was younger, and while I didn't enjoy it, I understood that it was for my own health and safety.

In terms of personal experiences, I have never had any negative effects from getting a vaccination shot. The only thing I have ever experienced is a sore arm, which is a common and temporary side effect. I trust that the vaccines have been thoroughly tested and approved by regulatory agencies before being made available to the public.

While I don't have access to my own medical records, I know that my doctor does and they have a way to go online and access that information. This allows them to have a complete picture of my medical history and make informed decisions about my healthcare.

When it comes to researching vaccines, I do my own research, especially when it comes to my children's health. I want to be well-informed and make the best decisions for their well-being. I go beyond just relying on my doctor's advice and seek out additional information. I look for reputable sources that have cited resources and compare the information I find with what my doctors tell me. I also reach out to my doctors to get their input and discuss any concerns or questions I may have. I believe that doctors can sometimes give routine advice, and while I value their expertise, I also trust my own instincts as a mother and take that into consideration.

One of the biggest concerns I have heard about vaccines is the potential link between vaccines and conditions like autism, ADHD, and ADD. It is alarming to think that something we trust our doctors to do could potentially harm our children. The prevalence of these conditions in the United States compared to other countries raises questions about why that is. As a parent, I naturally want to protect my child from any harm, so the idea of vaccines causing harm is concerning. I also wonder if my children really need all the vaccines they are recommended to receive and what the consequences would be if they don't get them. It's a lot to think about, especially when considering that in the past, there weren't as many vaccines available and yet children were still getting sick and dying from other diseases. It's a complex issue with unanswered questions, and I am waiting for more concrete answers.

The constant development of new vaccines also raises concerns for me. It feels like there is always a new vaccine being introduced, and I wonder where the cutoff is. Will we be vaccinating against every possible disease in the future? It can be overwhelming to think about giving my children so many shots, and I question if there will be even more vaccines in the future for other things. It feels like there is a never-ending cycle of new vaccines, and it makes me wonder if there will ever be a point where we can say "enough is enough." I also worry about the potential side effects and long-term effects of these new vaccines.

In conclusion, as a patient, I have chosen to vaccinate my children because I believe in the benefits of vaccination. I have not personally experienced any negative effects from vaccines and trust that they have been thoroughly tested and approved. However, I also understand the concerns and questions that some people have about vaccines, such as the potential link to certain conditions and the constant development of new vaccines. It is a complex issue that requires careful consideration and ongoing research.
